# **Elbanna.org - God Money Coin (GMC)**  

## **Abstract**  
Elbanna.org introduces **God Money Coin (GMC)**, a decentralized blockchain designed for fairness, speed, and infinite scalability. By utilizing the **GhostRider algorithm**, enhanced with **Kaspa's DAG-based speed** and orphan-free architecture, GMC delivers real-time transaction finality without block delays. The consensus model removes the concept of "block time" entirely, enabling seamless performance.

To ensure sustainability and fairness, GMC employs:  
- **CPU-only mining** with a **kill switch** for miners exceeding **1,000 KH/s**.  
- A **Doge-like supply model** with infinite rewards fixed at **1,000 GMC per block**.  
- Integrated **smart contracts**, asset creation, NFTs, data transfers, and secure decentralized email.  

GMC also features **.bit decentralized DNS domains**, improving decentralization and Web3 usability. Partnerships are planned with **Namecoin** and **Nervos Network** to enhance adoption.  

---

## **Core Features**  

### **1. Real-Time, Orphan-Free Consensus**  
- Built on the **GhostRider algorithm**, optimized with **Kaspa's DAG technology**.  
- Ensures transactions are processed in **real time** with zero orphan blocks.  
- The removal of "block time" creates a timeless, high-speed consensus mechanism.

---

### **2. Fair and Decentralized Mining**  
- **CPU-only Mining**: ASICs and GPUs are **automatically rejected**.  
- **Kill Switch**: Mining addresses exceeding **1,000 KH/s** are disabled to maintain fairness.  
- Designed to prevent centralization, ensuring mining remains accessible to everyone worldwide.

---

### **3. Sustainable Infinite Supply**  
- Rewards are fixed at **1,000 GMC per block**.  
- No halving events. Supply remains infinite, modeled after **DogeCoin** to sustain global adoption.  

---

### **4. Integrated Smart Contracts**  
Supports **LVMP-based smart contracts** for:  
- **Asset Creation**: Launch and manage fungible/non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  
- **Data Transfers**: Seamless on-chain data transactions.  
- **NFT Marketplace**: Mint, transfer, and trade NFTs on the GMC blockchain.  
- **Decentralized Email**: Secure messaging embedded into the blockchain network.  

---

### **5. Decentralized DNS (.bit Domains)**  
- **.bit domains** provide decentralized alternatives to traditional domain names.  
- Designed for seamless Web3 integration.  
- Planned partnerships with **Namecoin** and **Nervos Network** to enhance interoperability.

## **Technical Specifications**  

| **Parameter**          | **Specification**                     |  
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
| **Consensus Algorithm** | GhostRider with DAG-based optimization |  
| **Block Reward**        | 1,000 GMC per block (fixed, infinite) |  
| **Mining Method**       | CPU-only, 1,000 KH/s kill switch      |  
| **Supply Model**        | Infinite supply, Doge-like            |  
| **Smart Contracts**     | LVMP-based; supports assets, NFTs, data transfers |  
| **DNS Integration**     | .bit domains for decentralized naming |  

---

## **Fairness Mechanism**  
GMC ensures mining remains **fair and decentralized**:  
- **CPU-Only Enforcement**: GPUs and ASICs are rejected from the network.  
- **Anti-Overpower Kill Switch**: Addresses exceeding **1,000 KH/s** are temporarily disabled.  
- Keeps mining open to all individuals globally without allowing centralized control.

---

## **Conclusion**  
Elbanna.org’s GMC creates a **timeless, decentralized, and fair blockchain** built for the modern era. By removing block time, integrating orphan-free DAG speed, and prioritizing global accessibility with CPU-only mining, GMC redefines blockchain sustainability and scalability.
